Python project to find location based on an image of the night sky

This project is very much still in progress, and is not able to be run on systems other than the laptop I designed it on as of now. 
Much of the fine tuning for the field of view of the image and rotation of the image are unfinished, 
and the system to automatically find the values is not yet finished, so the values used are values specifically created to work with the set of images I collected and tested with.

The commented sections are often results of troubleshooting, so they may be helpful in seeing the thought process behind developing the system.
